If you have any questions regarding the fields on the motor journey, please raise an issue against this repo, and one of the team will answer your query.

When assessing your test we will take the following things into account:
  - Design of your framework & approach
  - Code quality
  - Code clarity
  - Wording of your tests
  - How easily we can run the tests
  - Documentation (please include a README file within your solution)

If you are invited for an interview then you will be required to walk the interviewers through your code and you may be required to make some modifications to your framework as part of the interview.
